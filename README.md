# NLG_BERT

This repo Implements [Incorporating BERT into Neural Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.06823.pdf) paper.
The paper only covers NMT Task, but in this repo Dialogue Gerneration Task has added up.

Currently Pretrained Large Models are prevailing in various NLP Tasks. However unfortunately, there are relatively little research on how to incorporate it into natural language generation.

**Incorporating BERT into Neural Machine Translation** presents one way to apply pre-trained model to a Natural Language Generation Task.
